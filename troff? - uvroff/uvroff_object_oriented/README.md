## UVroff_object_oriented

### What is it?
In assignment 3 of SENG265, we were required to transfrom the uvroff program that was in imperative style (showed at the parent directory "troff? -uvroff") to **object-oriented** style

### implementation
"UVroff_class" is namely a class that does the same formatting functions, however with applying OO style, couple things changed. 

1. Consider interface. With class, we have interface. Class hides implementation detail of uvroff, interface expose about how to use it.
